### Hi,

i'm Felix, passionate learner in the field of Cloud Computing and Data Science / ML / AI related topics.
Currently, IÂ´m diving deeper into Azure and working towards my first Certification.

Alongside my technical pursuits, I am currently studying economics with a focus on business informatics. I believe that combining my knowledge in economics and business informatics with cloud computing, data science, ML, and AI will provide a unique perspective in understanding and addressing complex business challenges.

On my GitHub profile, you will find a collection of smaller projects, and resources related to cloud computing, Azure, Data Science, ML, and AI. I enjoy collaborating and sharing my learnings with the community, so feel free to explore and provide feedback on any of my mini projects.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
